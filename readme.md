KOST MANAGEMENT

Kost Management is a property management application designed to help boarding house (kost) owners or managers manage their rooms in a detailed and organized way.

This application allows users to monitor each room individually, including:

    - room occupancy status (vacant or occupied),

    - tenant information per room,

    - and monthly payment tracking to check whether rent has been paid or is still pending.

With Kost Management, managers can:

    - easily monitor all rooms from a single dashboard,

    - quickly identify unpaid or overdue monthly payments,

    - and maintain well-structured, transparent, and efficient boarding house records.

The main goal of this application is to simplify boarding house administration, reduce manual record-keeping, and improve accuracy in managing room and payment data.
